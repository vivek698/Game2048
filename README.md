# Getting Started with this App

A vanilla JS app, which can easily be deployed to Heroku.

This code's origin is [Sudoku JS](https://codepen.io/Mobius1/pen/EmJEoJ) by Karl Saunders.

This project was bootstrapped according to [this article](https://medium.com/@winnieliang/how-to-run-a-simple-html-css-javascript-application-on-heroku-4e664c541b0b) by Winnie Liang

## Deploying to Heroku

Install the [Heroku CLI](https://cli.heroku.com/).

```sh
$ heroku create
$ git push heroku master
$ heroku open
```

## Running Locally

To run this App locally I use the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) plugin in VS Code.
